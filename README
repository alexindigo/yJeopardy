             I'll take 'Colors that end in -urple' for $200
                           What is Light Urple?

Howdy!  If you are reading this, you're probably wondering: what is this folder,
why am I here, who am I, why are you wearing a purple suit?  Most of these
questions I can't answer.  But the important one, #1, I can.  This folder
contains all the code you need to run Yahoo! Jeopardy.  A little side project
that St. John Johnson, Alex Ivashchenko, and Suresh Jayanty created for the
2010 Systools Holiday Party.




                              ** Preamble **
Y! Jeopardy uses several 3rd party open source libraries and tools.
This file summarizes the tools used, their purpose, and the licenses under which they're released.

Except as specifically stated below, the 3rd party software packages are not distributed as part of
this project, but instead are separately downloaded from the respective provider and built on the
developerâ€™s machine as a pre-build step.

Downloaded javascript libraries should be placed under htdocs/a folder in respectful directories,
except prototype.js which should placed directly into htdocs/a folder.

* prototype version 1.7 (MIT license)
(Prototype is a JavaScript Framework that aims to ease development of dynamic web applications.)
[http://prototypejs.org/]
-----------------------
* script.aculo.us version 1.8.3 (MIT license)
(script.aculo.us provides you with easy-to-use, cross-browser user interface JavaScript libraries to make your web sites and web applications fly.)
[http://script.aculo.us/]
-----------------------
* livepipe (MIT license)
(LivePipe UI is a suite of high quality widgets and controls for web 2.0 applications built using the Prototype JavaScript Framework.)
[http://livepipe.net/]
-----------------------
* zepto version 0.4 (MIT license)
(Zepto.js is a minimalist JavaScript framework for mobile WebKit browsers, with a jQuery-compatible syntax.)

                            ** Installation **
The installation is relatively simple on most machines (except Yahoo boxes).

Requirements:
 - Some sort of HTTP server (apache preferred)
 - PHP 5..something
 - PHP Json (yphp_json)
 - PHP APC (yphp_apc)

It's best to point your root URL at public_html/
 - Example: http://yjeopardy.yahoo.com/ => public_html/
Otherwise, there might be some minor errors with CSS/JS absolute path junk



                            ** Configuration **
Configuration is done in the Config.php file
 - ADMIN_USERNAME is the Username to access admin.php and test.php
 - ADMIN_PASSWORD is the Password to access admin.php and test.php
 - ADMIN_SECRET is a secret key that is required for all admin API commands.
                Basically, it prevents malicious users from abusing your system.
 - NUM_ROUNDS is.. well the number of rounds in the game

Questions are stored in questions/ (duh) and should be in the format:
 - round-{ROUND NUMBER}.yaml

The contents of these files are stored in a relatively confusing format (jk):

Category 1:
  Points:
  - Question
  - Answer
  Points:
  - Question
  - Answer
  - Daily Double

If you don't provide a Daily Double, one will automagically be picked.



                             ** Gameplay **
Note: The CSS/JS actions in this game were designed for use in a WebKit browser.
      It will work in other browsers (kinda), but won't look as pretty.  So try
      to use Chrome (woohoo) or Safari (yuck).

The main screen can be accessed via /main.html
  It was designed to look the prettiest in full screen mode
  Also, there are no sounds - future feature, I swear

The admin panel can be accessed via /admin.php (username/password set in config)
  This was made for a hand-held device (iPhone or Droid)

The user interface can be accessed via /index.php or alternate UI /index.php?alt
  This was also made for a hand-held device (iPhone or Droid)

For testing, you can also use /text.php (username/password set in config)
  This gives you access to test the raw API calls



                             ** Side Notes **
Any questions regarding gameplay, installation, or configuration - please feel
free to ping any one of us.  We don't bite (actually scratch that, I think Alex
has been known to).

Important people to thank:
 - Chris Arnold, for the original idea and questions
 - Fergus Sullivan, for more questions and mental support
 - Boba Fett, for being the man

Appropriate distribution of blame:
 - Main screen and Primary UI
   - Alex Ivashchenko <alexi@yahoo-inc.com>
 - Alternate UI and Admin UI
   - St. John Johnson <stjohn@yahoo-inc.com>
